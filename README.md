# toxvaldbmain

# Background
ToxValDB is a large compilation of in vivo toxicology data and risk assessment values. The database originated in response to the need for consistently annotated and computable toxicology data for use in the development and validation of non-animal new approach methods (NAMs). The database has two major components. The first, ToxValDB Stage contains data that closely match data from each source, in both structure and terminology. The second (the main ToxValDB database) maps all source data to a consistent structure and set of vocabularies. The current version of the database (9.6.0) contains 238,617 records covering 39,669 chemicals from over 40 sources.

# Repository Content
This repository contains the R scripts used to generate the "Main" database for ToxValDB.
