Title: Builds the ToxValDB V9.x Database
Version: 1.0.1
Author: Taylor Wall
Maintainer: Taylor Wall <wall.taylor@epa.gov>
Description: ToxValDB is a database containing quantitative records form in vivo toxicologye studies from 
  many sources. The database has 2 main parts - toxval_source containing 
  source data in separate tables, and the main toxval schema which combines data from multiple sources 
  into a single format. This project moves data from toxval_soruce to toxval.
  Data is read from files or other databases into toxval_source and then pulled 
  into toxval where terms are converted to standard values. The ToxValDB SOPs describe in more 
  detail how to run the code. This version is setup to build ToxValDB v9.5
