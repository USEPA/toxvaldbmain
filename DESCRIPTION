Title: Builds the ToxValDB v9.6.0 Database
Version: 9.6.0
Author: Taylor Wall
Maintainer: Taylor Wall <wall.taylor@epa.gov>
Description: ToxValDB is a database containing quantitative records from in vivo toxicology studies from 
  many sources. The database has 2 main parts - toxval_source containing 
  source data in separate tables, and the main toxval schema which combines data from multiple sources 
  into a single format. This package moves data from toxval_source to toxval.
  Data is read from files or other databases into toxval_source and then pulled 
  into toxval where terms are converted to standard values. This version is setup to build ToxValDB v9.6.0.
