# toxvaldbstage

# Background
ToxValDB is a large compilation of in vivo toxicology data and risk assessment values. The database originated in response to the need for consistently annotated and computable toxicology data for use in the development and validation of non-animal new approach methods (NAMs). The database has two major components. The first, ToxValDB Stage contains data that closely match data from each source, in both structure and terminology. The second (the main ToxValDB database) maps all source data to a consistent structure and set of vocabularies. The current version of the database (9.5) contains 388,104 records covering 44,192 chemicals from 50 sources.

# Repository Content
