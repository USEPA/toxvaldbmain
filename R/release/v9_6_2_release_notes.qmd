# Overview

The Toxicity Values Database (ToxValDB) contains summary data on *in vivo* toxicology experiments and assessments. This release note seeks to describe the process for creating ToxValDB and highlight recent changes that the user can expect in the annual release of this resource. Summary files and the full MySQL database download are available publicly on FigShare (no account required) in this [FigShare Dataset](https://doi.org/10.23645/epacomptox.20394501.v10). Note, the FigShare DOI link will land on the most recent version of the FigShare posting. Use the version dropdown menu to navigate to the desired release version based on the dataset title. The data are also available publicly as a [Zenodo Dataset](https://zenodo.org/uploads/15527355).

The ToxValDB `r toxval_version` contains `r format(n_records$n, big.mark=",")` records covering `r format(n_chemicals$n, big.mark=",")` chemicals `r n_chemicals_defined` from `r n_sources$n` sources (`r length(n_source_tables)` source tables).

In addition to this release note, the following summary files are available:

-   Data file column dictionary\_`r toxval_version %>% gsub("\\.", "_", .)`.xlsx
-   source_count `r toxval_version %>% gsub("\\.", "_", .)`.xlsx
-   source_info `r toxval_version %>% gsub("\\.", "_", .)`.xlsx

# Workflow

The overall workflow is illustrated in @fig-toxvaldbworkflow2.

Applicable data are identified from a number of sources (see @tbl-qc-status-summ-pass) and loaded into the toxval_source MySQL database. Each source has different fields and uses different terminology, so a custom source-specific database table is developed for each source. A custom R script is written to pre-process and load each source, although these functions follow a standard template and use common, generic functions when possible.

Records are reviewed in the "toxval_source" database by source. To facilitate this quality control (QC) process, the source documents are collected and uploaded to the CCTE Clowder cloud-based document repository and linked to corresponding records in toxval_source.

The extent of QC for ToxValDB data is determined by source and is based on whether data were extracted manually from an unstructured data source or extracted computationally from a structured data source. Documentation of source-level QC prior to ToxValDB import is also considered. There are two tiers of QC, Level 0 and Level 1.

Level 0 QC is a manual evaluation within a source to check for any systematic errors (e.g., duration field is populated with duration values). For any sources that fail Level 0 QC, the source import process is reviewed and revised until all fields containing information from the source are correctly displayed in ToxValDB.

Level 1 QC entails an evaluation of extraction accuracy by comparing ToxValDB records to the source where data are extracted. The goal is to ensure records in ToxValDB are accurate representations of the source data. When errors are identified during Level 1 QC, the record is corrected and adjustments made to the full set of source records based on the error type (e.g., systematic, semantic). Level 1 QC of the data importation typically involves a subsample of the full source, where the number of records reviewed is based on the data extraction method. For programmatically extracted sources, a random subsample of 100 records is reviewed in an export file from each source. The assumption in reviewing a subset of records is that systematic errors introduced by the programmatic extraction and processing would be identified in Level 0 QC, and that a subsample is representative of the whole. When errors are identified, the extraction and import code is revised, and the data are re-imported and refreshed. Level 1 QC continues until all 100 subsampled records pass review without error.

For manually extracted sources within ToxValDB, a minimum of 20% of records are manually and independently reviewed for accuracy under Level 1 QC. For selected records, QC is performed to evaluate the accuracy of ToxValDB records with the original document(s). The source record from ToxVal Source DB is displayed alongside the extraction document, and a reviewer confirms that the values in the record match those in the document. When errors are identified during Level 1 QC, the record is corrected in ToxVal Source DB. An audit trail of QC actions is incorporated into the ToxVal Source DB and processed into the ToxVal Main DB. Finally, for data derived from ToxRefDB, QC is conducted prior to inclusion in the original databases and no additional Level 1 QC is required.

In addition to source Level 0 and Level 1 QC, a series of data profiling reports are generated on the complete database to flag records or fields for review that could be potentially erroneous. For example, a report of unique combinations of effect type, exposure route, and dose units is reviewed for consistency (e.g., a record with an oral exposure route and units in mg/m3 {common inhalation exposure unit} would be evaluated against the source document). Additional reports are generated to flag potential duplicate records as well as records with a large numeric spread or deviation within a chemical.

After import into toxval_source and QC, the data for all sources are transferred to the main "toxval" database and mapped to a common set of database fields. Most fields have an "original" column (indicated by the stem "\_original"), to reflect the value exactly as is present in the source database (and the source files), and a "final" column, to reflect standardized values using ToxValDB vocabularies and unit conversions. Examples of changes in the original to final mappings are to correct misspellings, to convert between scientific and common species names, and variant terms for study types.

An important part of both "toxval_source" and "toxval" databases is making sure that chemicals are correctly identified. The sources provides chemical identifiers, which may include name and/or a CAS Registry Number (CASRN). These values are collected and reviewed for matches in EPA’s Distributed Structure-Searchable Toxicity (DSSTox) database by an expert chemical curation team via the ChemReg internal-to-EPA application. This effort results in a curated DSSTox substance ID (DTXSID), which can be used as the primary chemical identifier in ToxValDB.

With a few exceptions, the complete workflow is carried out using code in an R package. Originally derived from the toxvaldb92 R package, the package is now split into two to reflect the separate "import" and "load" processes. The names have been changed to "[toxvaldbstage](https://github.com/USEPA/toxvaldbstage)" (import) and "[toxvaldbmain](https://github.com/USEPA/toxvaldbmain)" (load), respectively. Both are accessible on the USEPA GitHub.

# Features

## Schema Changes

-   No schema changes were made for this version.

## Processing Changes

-   Release notes autogenerated with R Quarto as of v9.6.0.
-   No processing changes were made for this version.

# Known Issues

-   Missing Regional Screening Level (RSL) data: a subset of chemicals with RSL values are missing from the CompTox Chemicals Dashboard (CCD) Executive Summary RSL Table and from the Hazard subtab.
-   A subset of records is absent from all the included ECHA IUCLID subsources due to chemical mapping issues where the team elected to remove them entirely rather than potentially release records with inaccurate chemical identifiers.

# Future Development

-   Data Source Curation
    -   EPA OPP
        -   Manual curation of oral chronic RfD POD data from EPA OPP risk assessment documents complete. Following QC, records will be added in a future release.
    -   Additional state (e.g., Minnesota Department of Health (MDH), New Jersey, Illinois), federal, and international sources in progress.
-   Process
    -   Disambiguate lifestage and generation fields.
    -   Standardize the subsource field.

# QC Status Counts

Summary of the sources and counts with QC status values in `r toxval_version`.

Colors indicate:

-   QC Pass
    -   All low to high (white to green).

    -   Column groups (different gradient scales):

        -   chemicals

        -   total records, pass, not determined

        -   pass percent
-   QC Fail
    -   Column groups (different gradient scales):

        -   total records

            -   Low to High (white to green)

        -   fail columns (see caption for failure tag description)

            -   Low to High (light green to light red)

i.  QC fail status tags listed as programmatically applied during load to ToxValDB toxval table, except for the "fail" status which is from a manually reviewed record.
ii. Note, an individual record can have multiple fail tags (e.g., 'fail: species out of scope; Eco data out of scope for ToxValDB' would be tag 'e' and tag 'h').
iii. Failure column tags:
